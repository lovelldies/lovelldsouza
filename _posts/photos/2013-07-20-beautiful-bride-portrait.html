        <p>These are a couple of my favorite shots of the bride from a wedding that I documented in Hyderabad a while back. The first photograph was shot with me having to stand on a chair to create enough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field" title="DoF on Wikipedia" target="_blank">depth of field</a> allowing me to keep her eyes in focus.</p>
        <p>After spending enough time getting some nice bridal shots, we had to rush to the wedding hall as things were behind schedule. All the ladies accompanying in bride are going, &#8216;Rush rush! We are late&#8217;. And then we find ourselves in the hallway. Thought we&#8217;d take a couple of shots, not much to the amusement of the elder women standing behind us. But nevertheless, the corridor was long and empty, the ceiling was low, flashes were at full charge, we had to stop!</p>
