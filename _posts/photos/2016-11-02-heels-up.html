excerpt: By the end of the trip, our shoes had taken a beating, our calf muscles were worked a lot, and I guess our bums got a little bit toned too.

      <p>Our final destination, while moving across the <a href="https://happyfeet.us/russia/100-years-of-trans-siberian/" target="_blank">Trans-Siberian Railway</a>, was Vladivostok. We really walked a lot during this trip. Easily over 500 kms (my math has it at 600+, but I need to refine the data), with an average of 10 to 15 kilometers a day. We even walked more than 25 kilometers on a few days.</p>

      <p>The infrastructure in Russia is at some other level (as compared to India, where you do not find any foot paths/sidewalks) and walking was so convenient. The cities are pedestrian friendly, and getting from one place to another was such a breeze. By the end of the trip, our shoes had taken a beating, our calf muscles were worked a lot, and I guess our bums got a little bit toned too.</p>

      <p>Russia! Number one country in the world!</p>
