			<p>Another man down! And hopefully no more re-spawning required for this event in life. The madman who would sometimes take the entire team down with his accidental (or maybe intentional, we would never know) TKs (Counter-Strike), finally tied the knot. Whatâ€™s going to happen to his lovely wife now, no one knows.</p>

      <p>Thanks to the enthusiasm of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/weddings/clare-suneet-goa/" target="_blank">lawyer friend and his pregnant wife</a>, my <a href="http://happyfeet.us/author/priya/" target="_blank">pretty wife</a> and the good looking couple, we walked through some muddy paths, past a decomposed dog and were able to get some lovely photographs during sunset at Siolim.</p>

      <p>Here they are! Mr. Fernandes and Mrs. Chettri.</p>
