    <p>As some of you might know, cool things happened, and we landed up with <a href="http://www.lovelldsouza.com/photos/lesley-and-nilima/" target="_blank">this photo</a> of that hairy man and his wife from the mountains. A couple of days prior to this, paperwork was done and the government acknowledged the new Mr. and Mrs. Here are some scenes from that afternoon at Mapusa and Guirim.</p>

    <p>Having completed the formalities, we walked around the office and tried to locate a decent spot to get a photo. Unfortunately we were met with a lot of pigeon and bat poop. Luckily, the common spaces were cleaner, to some extent.</p>

    <p>And then we partied away at the Vrundavan Cafe in Mapusa. A lot of cups of tea were consumed.</p>

    <p>Lesley, being Lesley, was busy pretending to be shy, or was acting busy, making unnecessary phone calls. The sun was peeping through the trees and the golden hour was at its best!</p>

    <p>And then, to keep the history books updated, we took a few shots of the mane.</p>

    <p>The couple, and I would like to thank Clare, Suneet, Priya and Srijay, for their time and effort behind the scenes. Especially Suneet and Srijay, for their hard work and patience. I, on the other hand, would have shot Lesley multiple times by now.</p>
