excerpt: Day zero at a place that the adults kept referring to as the beach. I wasn't sure what to expect, but they said that it would be a lot of fun.

    <p>And they were right. The beach was indeed an exciting place. I could feel the wind in my face and the soft cushioning under my feet that the adults referred to as sand. We walked on a lot of sand. Some of it was dry and a lot of it was wet.</p>
    <p>And the water! The water was everywhere! I had not seen so much water before. And all of it was crashing right at my feet. The adults kept calling it waves.</p>

    <p>Lucky me, I had Daddy and I held Daddy&#8217;s hand and went in to take a closer look.</p>

    <p>I think I love this thing called waves.</p>

    <p>We built sand castles later and got totally wet, thanks to the waves. What a day!</p>
