      <p>My debut at documenting a wedding.</p>
      <p>I step into Evelyn's home and announce that I'm gonna be clicking photos. The photographer hired gave me a dirty look. </p>
      <p>Armed with my Canon EOS 1000D, a Canon 50mm 1.8, Canon 18-55mm and a Tamron 70-300mm I decided to click away. 680 photos were clicked that day. I managed to bring it down to around 161 that made it to this album. This is Evelyn's and Ryan's wedding in Goa.</p>
