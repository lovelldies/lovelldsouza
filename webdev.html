    <p>Yes, you landed on the right page. I make websites, provide web solutions to agencies and businesses out there, and also write code and throw it out there so that the internet can be a better place. I’ve not updated this space with all the work I’ve done, since I’m clogged with assignments now, and don’t have to time to show off. But I’ll do that soon. If you need a website set up, or need any solutions feel free to contact me (contact details at the bottom).</p>
