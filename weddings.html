    <p>Photography has always been fun. Something I got into by accident. You can ask me to narrate the “How the Canon 1000D asked me to pick it up” story over a drink some day. Wedding photography however, has been even more fun. As clichéd as it may sound, making those memories has always been a source of great pleasure. From clicking friends’ weddings with the cheap Canon 1000D and 50mm f1.8 lens to making wedding memories with a 5D Mark II with L series weaponry attached to it, it has been three exciting years of rocket science.</p>
    <p>Here is a photo collection of all the weddings I have clicked so far. You will find Flickr links to most of the wedding albums (Some albums are private). If you think it would be an awesome idea to have me document your wedding, leave me a note on my <a href="/contact/" title="Contact Me" target="_blank">contact page</a> and I shall let you know that the idea is awesome indeed and will get back to you ASAP.</p>
    <p>Like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lovelldsouzaphotography" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> for updates. I tend to show off/rant a lot over there. You can read the <a href="/reviews/" title="Reviews">reviews</a>, left by folks I have worked with on the link provided or on my <a href="https://plus.google.com/106976660327299190379/about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google Places Page</a>. Below are the albums. Have fun. Feel free to go through the <a href="http://www.lovelldsouza.com/weddings/faq/" target="_blank">Wedding FAQs</a> in case required.</p>
